## Document Organization and Folders

Organize your documentation using intuitive folder structures. You create top-level folders for major categories like "API Reference" or "User Guides," then nest subfolders for finer granularity.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Folder" icon="folder-plus">
    Navigate to the root directory. Click the new folder icon and name it `guides`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Nest Subfolders" icon="folder">
    Inside `guides`, create `quickstart` and `advanced`. Drag documents between folders.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reorder" icon="move">
    Use drag-and-drop to rearrange. Folders sync across all team members.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Prefix folder names with numbers like `01-introduction` for automatic sorting.

## Collaboration and Sharing Options

Collaborate by inviting team members with role-based permissions. You share public links or embed documents.

<CodeGroup tabs="Invite,Share">
  ```javascript
  // API to invite user (for integrations)
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/invites', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${YOUR_TOKEN}` },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      email: 'team@company.com',
      role: 'editor'
    })
  });
  ```
  ```bash
  # Share via CLI tool
  raxmatullo share /docs/guides --public --password=secret123
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Callout kind="info">
  Real-time cursors show who edits what, reducing conflicts.
</Callout>

## Search and Version Control Basics

Search across all documents with full-text indexing. Filter by folder, tag, or date. Version control uses Git under the hood—you commit changes and view history.

<Expandable title="View Version History" default-open="true">
  Right-click a document and select "History." Compare diffs side-by-side.
